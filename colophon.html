        Each person who views this site will view their own virtual cross stitch world.  There are many possible colors and shapes, rivers and tributaries, growths and obstructions.

      <p>
        This artwork can create as many as 4 Billion possible worlds, created for each viewer using their unique device settings.

        <P>
          Inspired by <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2014/09/kafka-illustrated-with-pinscreen-art.html">Kafka's parable "Before the Law"</a>, the door has opened up a world that was made only for you. But unlike in Kafka's parable, this world is accessible to you. Enjoy!
